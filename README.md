# Battleship

This was a paired project for the backend engineering program at Turing School of Software and Design in Mod 1. Battleship uses Ruby to build a command line implementation of the classic game, Battleship. This is a playable game of Battleship that runs in a REPL interface. The game will allow a single human player to play against a (simplistic) computer player.

## The Game
Both the Human Player and the Computer have a 4 x 4 board that holds their ships. Each of them has 2 ships: The Cruiser which is 3 cells long and The Submarine which is 2 cells. A board will look like this:

Each `S` represents part of a ship and each `.` represents an empty space. During the main phase of the game, the computer and the player take turns firing at each otherâ€™s ships. The board shown above might look like this after a couple rounds of firing:

Where `H` represents a hit, `M` represents a shot that missed, and `X` represents a sunken ship.

The Game is over when either the User or Computer sinks both enemy ships
